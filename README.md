## OOP Pharmacy Manager

### Description
A school project to practice the basics of Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript, as well as practicing using Git to manage the project.

For this I developed a class-based “Pharmacy Inventory Management System”. The application allows users to enter data about different medicines, delete data, store the data, and display it.

This one was relatively easy to make, progress was smooth, but project itself was the most time-consuming of all.
